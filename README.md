# Dice Game

This project is a simple Dice game developed using TypeScript, Next.js, and Material UI. The game allows users to input a threshold number and choose whether the result of the dice roll should be greater or less than the specified threshold. Users can play the game, see the result, and view the history of their games.

## Features

**Threshold Input:** Users can enter a number that serves as a threshold.

**Condition Selection:** Users can choose whether the dice result should be "Greater" or "Less" than the threshold.

**Play Button:** Clicking the "Play" button generates a random number between 1 and 100 and evaluates whether it meets the specified condition.

**Result Display:** If the result meets the condition, a success message or icon is displayed.

**Game History:** The results of the last 10 games are stored and displayed as a history list.



## Technologies Used

_**TypeScript:**_ For type safety and better development experience.

**_Next.js:_** For server-side rendering and building the React application.

**_Material UI:_** For component library and styling the user interface.
